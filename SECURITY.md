## Security

Pravega takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Pravega owned repository, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Pravega Security Team via `email(mailto:security@pravega.io)`.

You should receive a response within 14 days. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Product version containing the vulnerability
  * Type of security exploit (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * The location of the vulnerability in the source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instruction to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Priority and Severity of the issue. Severity can be determined by Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
