## Security

DellEMC takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Pravega](https://github.com/pravega/pravega).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any DellEMC-owned repository that meets [DellEMC's definition of a security vulnerability](https://www.dell.com/support/contents/en-us/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/security-antivirus/alerts-vulnerabilities/dell-vulnerability-response-policy), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the DellEMC Product Security Incident Response Team (Dell PSIRT) via email(mailto:secure@dell.com).

If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Dell Vulnerability Response Policy page](https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/eSupport_Docs/en/dell_psirt_pub_key.txt).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [Dell EMC Product Security](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/products/security/index.htm). 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Product name and version containing the vulnerability
  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
