/**
 * Defines an abstraction for Permanent Storage.
 * Note: not all operations defined here are needed.
 * Below are minimum requirements that any implementation must provide.
 * Note that it is the responsibility of storage provider specific implementation to make sure following guarantees are
 * provided even though underlying storage may not provide all primitives or guarantees.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Once an operation is executed and acknowledged as successful then the effects must be permanent and consistent
 * (as opposed to eventually consistent)</li>
 * <li>{@link ChunkStorage#create(String)}  and {@link ChunkStorage#delete(ChunkHandle)} are not idempotent.</li>
 * <li>{@link ChunkStorage#exists(String)} and {@link ChunkStorage#getInfo(String)} must reflect effects of most recent
 * operation performed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * There is no need to implement any special logic to handle concurrent access to the underlying objects/files.
 *
 * There are a few different capabilities that ChunkStorage may provide.
 * <ul>
 * <li> Does {@link ChunkStorage} support appending to existing chunks?
 * This is indicated by {@link ChunkStorage#supportsAppend()}. For example S3 compatible Chunk Storage this would return false. </li>
 * <li> Does {@link ChunkStorage}  support for concatenating chunks? This is indicated by {@link ChunkStorage#supportsConcat()}.
 * If this is true then concat operation concat will be invoked otherwise append functionality is invoked.</li>
 * <li>In addition {@link ChunkStorage} may provide ability to truncate chunks at given offsets (either at front end or at tail end).
 * This is indicated by {@link ChunkStorage#supportsTruncation()}. </li>
 * </ul>
 * There are some obvious constraints - If ChunkStorage supports concat but not natively then it must support append .
 *
 * For concats, {@link ChunkStorage} supports both native and append, ChunkedSegmentStorage will invoke appropriate method depending
 * on size of target and source chunks. (Eg. ECS)
 *
 * It is recommended that the implementations should extend {@link BaseChunkStorage}.
