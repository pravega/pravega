     * Determines the largest Sequence Number that can be safely truncated from the Writer's Data Source. All operations
     * up to, and including the one for this Sequence Number have been successfully committed to External Storage.
     *
     * The Sequence Number we acknowledge has the property that all operations up to, and including it, have been
     * committed to Storage.
     *
     * This can only be calculated by looking at all the active SegmentAggregators and picking the Lowest Uncommitted
     * Sequence Number (LUSN) among all of those Aggregators that have any outstanding data. The LUSN for each aggregator
     * has the property that, within the context of that Aggregator alone, all Operations that have a Sequence Number (SN)
     * smaller than LUSN have been committed to Storage. As such, picking the smallest of all LUSN values across
     * all the active SegmentAggregators will give us the highest SN that can be safely truncated out of the OperationLog.
     * Note that LUSN still points to an uncommitted Operation, so we need to subtract 1 from it to obtain the highest SN
     * that can be truncated up to (and including).
     *
     * If we have no active Aggregators, then we have committed all operations that were passed to us, so we can
     * safely truncate up to LastReadSequenceNumber.
     *
     * As opposed from {@link #getLowestUncommittedSequenceNumber}, this method should be called for
     * {@link WriterSegmentProcessor} instances that deal with different Segments.
