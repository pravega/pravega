import java.util.Iterator;

/**
 * Represents a Read Result from a Stream Segment. This is essentially an Iterator over smaller, continuous ReadResultEntries.
 * Calls to hasNext() will return true only if the following conditions are all met:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The ReadResult is not closed
 * <li> The ReadResult has not reached the end of a sealed StreamSegment
 * <li> The ReadResult has not consumed all requested data (getConsumedLength() < getMaxResultLength())
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Calls to next() will return an element as long as hasNext() returns true. Some notes to consider:
 * <ul>
 * <li> next() will very likely not return the whole requested read range at the same time, even if subsequent calls to it
 * return contiguous data.
 * <li> next() will return a specific instance of ReadResultEntry, depending on where the data to be read is located.
 * <li> If next() returns an entry that has "isEndOfStreamSegment()" returning true, it means the Read Result has reached
 * the end of a sealed stream, and subsequent calls to hasNext() will return false.
 * <li> If the data is readily available in memory, the returned ReadResultEntry will contain an already completed future,
 * ready for consumption (using the regular CompletableFuture methods).
 * <li> If the data is not available in memory (currently), the returned ReadResultEntry will contain a CompletableFuture
 * that will be completed when data becomes available (pulled from Storage or Future Read). If the process of retrieving
 * data fails, the CompletableFuture will fail with the source exception as cause.
 * <li> If the data requested is beyond the last offset of the StreamSegment (Future Read), the returned CompletableFuture
 * will complete when at least 1 byte of data from that offset is available, or will fail with a TimeoutException when the
 * timeout expires or StreamSegmentSealedException if the StreamSegment has been sealed at or before its offset.
 * </ul>
