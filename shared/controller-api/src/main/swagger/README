** Instructions to generate Server REST API stubs **
* Update Controller.yaml
All REST API modifications should be done by updating the swagger/Controller.yaml file.
This can be done manually or by using the online editor - http://editor.swagger.io.

* Download Swagger codegen
Download swagger-codegen-cli from maven - http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/swagger-codegen-cli/2.2.1/swagger-codegen-cli-2.2.1.jar

* Generate the API stubs
Execute: java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i Controller.yaml -l jaxrs -c server.config.json -o <pravega root>/controller/server/

Delete redundant files: All files that get generated outside of the .../server/rest//generated folder should be deleted and not committed to git.

* Update ApiV1.java
The JAXRS API stubs decorated with swagger annoations are generated in .../server/rest//generated/api/*Api.java classes.
Copy these APIs descriptions into interfaces in ApiV1.java. Also ensure the APIs in ApiV1.java are made to use async interfaces.
