 * The class represents a Flow between a Segment client and the SegmentStore. It consists of a

 * connection pool. This <i>flowId</i> is unique per connection pool and a Flow is always tied to
 * a specific network connection.
 * The <i>requestSequenceNumber</i> is used to represent the requestSequence for a given Flow.
