 * duplicates, in the event that the writer process crashes and restarts.
 * 
 * This class is safe to use across threads, but doing so will not increase performance.

     * Send an event to the stream. Events that are written should appear in the stream exactly
     * once. Note that the implementation provides retry logic to handle connection failures and
     * service host failures.
     * 
     * This method takes a {@link Sequence} on each event for the purposes of preventing duplicates.
     * Sequences are user defined and assumed to be monotonically increasing. If a sequence is
     * passed to writeEvent that is less or equal to a sequence previously passed to writeEvent, the
     * event is acked without wiring it to the stream.
     * 
     * This allows for applications with a deterministic writer to de-dup events in the event that
     * the writer dies.
     * 
     * 
     * @param routingKey A free form string that is used to route messages to readers. Two events
     *        written with the same routingKey are guaranteed to be read in order. Two events with
     *        different routing keys may be read in parallel.
     * @param sequence An ever increasing sequence. If this method is called with a lower sequence
     *        the event will not be written.
     * @param event The event to be written to the stream
     * @return A future that will complete when the event has been durably stored on the configured
     *         number of replicas, and is available for readers to see. This future may complete
     *         exceptionally if this cannot happen, however these exceptions are not transient
     *         failures. Failures that occur as a result of connection drops or host death are
     *         handled internally with multiple retires and exponential backoff. So there is no need
     *         to attempt to retry in the event of an exception.
