     * The transaction timeout parameter corresponds to the lease renewal period.
     * In every period, the client must send at least one ping to keep the txn alive.
     * If the client fails to do so, then Pravega aborts the txn automatically. The client
     * sends pings internally and requires no application intervention, only that it sets
     * this parameter accordingly.
     *
     * This parameter is additionally used to determine the total amount of time that
     * a txn can remain open. Currently, we set the maximum amount of time for a
     * txn to remain open to be the minimum between 1 day and 1,000 times the value
     * of the lease renewal period. The 1,000 is hardcoded and has been chosen arbitrarily
     * to be a large enough value.
     *
     * The maximum allowed lease time by default is 120s, see:
     *
     * controller/src/main/resources/reference.conf
     *
     * The maximum allowed lease time is a configuration parameter of the controller
     * and can be changed accordingly. Note that being a controller-wide parameter,
     * it affects all transactions.
