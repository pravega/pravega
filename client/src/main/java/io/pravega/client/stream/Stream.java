 * A stream can be thought of as an unbounded sequence of events.
 * A stream can be written to or read from.
 * A stream is:
 * Append only (Events in it are immutable once written)
 * Unbounded (There are no limitations in how many events can go into a stream)
 * Strongly Consistent (Events are either in the stream or they are not, and not subject to reordering once written)
 * Scalable (The rate of events in a stream can greatly exceed the capacity of any single host)
