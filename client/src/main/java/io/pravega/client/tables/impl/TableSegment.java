/**
 * Defines all operations that are supported on a Table Segment.
 *
 * Types of updates:
 * * Unconditional Updates will insert and/or overwrite any existing values for the given Key, regardless of whether that Key
 * previously existed or not, and regardless of what that Key's version is.
 * * Conditional Updates will only overwrite an existing value if the specified version matches that Key's version. If
 * the key does not exist, the {@link TableSegmentKey} or {@link TableSegmentEntry} must have been created with
 * {@link TableSegmentKeyVersion#NOT_EXISTS} in order for the update to succeed.
 * * Unconditional Removals will remove a Key regardless of what that Key's version is. The operation will also succeed (albeit
 * with no effect) if the Key does not exist.
 * * Conditional Removals will remove a Key only if the specified {@link TableSegmentKey#getVersion()} matches that Key's version.
 * It will also fail (with no effect) if the Key does not exist and Version is not set to
 * {@link TableSegmentKeyVersion#NOT_EXISTS}.
 *
 * A note about {@link ByteBuf}s. All the methods defined in this interface make use of {@link ByteBuf} either directly
 * or via {@link TableSegmentKey}/{@link TableSegmentEntry}. It is expected that no implementation of the {@link TableSegment}
 * interface will either retain ({@link ByteBuf#retain()}) or release ({@link ByteBuf#release()}) these buffers during
 * execution. The lifecycle of these buffers should be maintained externally by the calling code, using the following
 * guidelines:
 * * For methods that accept externally-provided {@link ByteBuf}s, the calling code should call {@link ByteBuf#retain()}
 * prior to invoking the method on {@link TableSegment} and should invoke {@link ByteBuf#release()} afterwards.
 * * For methods that return internally-generated {@link ByteBuf}s (such as {@link #get}), the calling code should
 * invoke {@link ByteBuf#release()} as soon as it is done with processing the result. If the result needs to be held onto
 * for a longer duration, the caller should make a copy of it and release the {@link ByteBuf} that was provided from the
 * call.
