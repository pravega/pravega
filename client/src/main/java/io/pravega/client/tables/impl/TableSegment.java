/**
 * Defines all operations that are supported on a Table Segment.
 *
 * Types of updates:
 * * Unconditional Updates will insert and/or overwrite any existing values for the given Key, regardless of whether that Key
 * previously existed or not, and regardless of what that Key's version is.
 * * Conditional Updates will only overwrite an existing value if the specified version matches that Key's version. If
 * the key does not exist, the {@link TableKey} or {@link TableEntry} must have been created with {@link KeyVersion#NOT_EXISTS}
 * in order for the update to succeed.
 * * Unconditional Removals will remove a Key regardless of what that Key's version is. The operation will also succeed (albeit
 * with no effect) if the Key does not exist.
 * * Conditional Removals will remove a Key only if the specified {@link TableKey#getVersion()} matches that Key's version.
 * It will also fail (with no effect) if the Key does not exist and Version is not set to {@link KeyVersion#NOT_EXISTS}.
 *
