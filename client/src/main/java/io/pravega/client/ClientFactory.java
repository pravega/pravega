/**
 * Used to create Writers, Readers, and Synchronizers operating on a stream.
 * <p>
 * Events that are written to a stream can be read by a reader. All events can be processed with
 * exactly once semantics provided the reader has the ability to restore to the correct position
 * upon failure. See {@link EventRead#getPosition()}
 * <p>
 * A note on ordering: Events inside of a stream have a strict order, but may need to be divided
 * between multiple readers for scaling. In order to process events in parallel on different hosts
 * and still have some ordering guarantees; events written to a stream have a routingKey see
 * {@link EventStreamWriter#writeEvent(String, Object)}. Events within a routing key are strictly
 * ordered (i.e. They must go the the same reader or its replacement). However because
 * {@link ReaderGroup}s process events in parallel there is no ordering between different readers.
 *
 * <p>
 * A note on scaling: Because a stream can grow in its event rate, streams are divided into
 * Segments. For the most part this is an implementation detail. However its worth understanding
 * that the way a stream is divided between multiple readers in a group that wish to split the
 * messages between them is by giving different segments to different readers.
