/**
 * Allows for writing raw bytes directly to a segment. This is intended as low level building block
 * for creating higher level components. As such it can break things.
 * 
 * This class does not frame, attach headers, or otherwise modify the bytes written to it in any
 * way. So unlike {@link EventStreamWriter} or {@link RevisionedStreamClient} the data written
 * cannot be split apart when read. As such, any bytes written by this API can ONLY be read using
 * {@link ByteStreamReader}. Similarly, unless some sort of framing is added it is probably an error
 * to have multiple ByteStreamWriters write to the same segment as this will result in interleaved
 * data.
 * 
 * The methods on this class are non-blocking unless otherwise specified. As such data passed to a
 * {@link #write(byte[])} call cannot be assumed to be persisted until a flush has been called.
 * 
 * It is safe to invoke methods on this class from multiple threads but doing so will not result in
 * an increase in performance.
