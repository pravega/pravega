Pravega is an open source distributed storage service implementing **Streams**. It offers Stream as the main primitive for the foundation of reliable storage systems: a *high-performance, durable, elastic, and unlimited append-only byte stream with strict ordering and consistency*.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8+

## Building Pravega

Checkout the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/pravega/pravega.git
cd pravega
```

Build the pravega distribution:

```
./gradlew distribution
```

Install pravega jar files into the local maven repository. This is handy for running the `pravega-samples` locally against a custom version of pravega.

```
./gradlew install
```

Running unit tests:

```
./gradlew test
```

## Setting up your IDE

Pravega uses [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) so you should ensure you have your IDE setup with the required plugins. Using IntelliJ is recommended.

To import the source into IntelliJ:

1. Import the project directory into IntelliJ IDE. It will automatically detect the gradle project and import things correctly.
2. Enable `Annotation Processing` by going to `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler` > `Annotation Processors` and checking 'Enable annotation processing'.
3. Install the `Lombok Plugin`. This can be found in `Preferences` -> `Plugins`. Restart your IDE.
4. Pravega should now compile properly.

For eclipse, you can generate eclipse project files by running `./gradlew eclipse`.
