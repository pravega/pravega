# Running Pravega

Running in local machine allows us to get started using Pravega very quickly. Most of the options uses the standalone mode which is suitable for most of the development and testing.

The prerequisites for running in local machine is described below.

## Standalone Mode

### From Source

First we need to have the Pravega source code checked out to download the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/pravega/pravega.git
cd pravega
```

As a next step compile Pravega and start the standalone deployment.

```
./gradlew startStandalone
```

### From Installation Package

Download the Pravega latest release from the [github releases page](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/releases). The tarball or zip files can be used as they are identical. Instructions are provided for the tar files, but the same can be used for the zip file also.


```
tar xfvz pravega-0.1.0.tgz
```

Run Pravega standalone:

```
pravega-0.1.0/bin/pravega-standalone
```

### From Docker Container

The below command will download and run Pravega from the container image on docker hub.

**Note:** We must replace the `<ip>` with the IP of our machine to connect to Pravega from our local machine. Optionally we can replace `latest` with the version of Pravega as per the requirement.


```
docker run -it -e HOST_IP=<ip> -p 9090:9090 -p 12345:12345 pravega/pravega:latest standalone
```

## Docker Compose (Distributed Mode)

Unlike other options for running locally, the docker compose option runs a full Pravega install in distributed mode. It contains containers for running Zookeeper, Bookkeeper and HDFS. Hence Pravega operates as if it would in production. This is the easiest way to get started with the standalone option but requires additional resources.


To use this we need to have Docker `1.12` or later versions.

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/tree/master/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml) from github. For example:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pravega/pravega/master/docker/compose/docker-compose.yml
```

We need to set the IP address of our local machine as the value of HOST_IP in the following command.
```
HOST_IP=1.2.3.4 docker-compose up
```
Clients can then connect to the controller at `${HOST_IP}:9090`.

## Configuring standalone

The configuration properties for standalone can be specified in `config/standalone-config.properties`.

These properties include ports for zookeeper, segment store and controller. They also contain other configurations related to security.

## Running standalone with encryption and authentication enabled

The configurations, `singlenode.enableTls` and `singlenode.enableauth` can be used to enable encryption and authentication respectively.(By default both these settings are disabled).

In case `enableTls` is set to true, the default certificates provided in the `conf` directory are used for setting up TLS. These can be overridden by specifying in the properties file.


Clients can then connect to the controller at `${HOST_IP}:9090`.
