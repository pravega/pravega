# Client _auth_ Interface
Pravega client can access Pravega APIs through `grpc`. Some of the admin APIs can be accessed via `REST` API. 
The Authorization/Authentication API and plugin works for both of these interfaces.

## grpc Client _auth_ Interface
If multiple plugin exists, a client selects its _auth_ handler by setting a `grpc` header with the name `method`. 
This is performed by implementing [Credentials](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/client/src/main/java/io/pravega/client/stream/impl/Credentials.java) interface by passing through the [ClientConfig](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/client/src/main/java/io/pravega/client/ClientConfig.java) object to the Pravega client.
The parameters for authentication are passed through custom `grpc` headers. These are extracted through `grpc` interceptors and passed on to the specific _auth_ plugin.
This plugin is identified by the `method` header.

## Dynamic extraction of the _auth_ parameters on the client
Dynamic extraction of parameters is also possible using the system properties or environment variables.
The order of preference is listed below:

1. User explicitly provides a credential object through the API. This results in overriding the other settings.
2. System properties: System properties are defined in the format: `pravega.client.auth.*`
3. Environment variables: Environment variables are defined in the format: `pravega_client_auth_*`
4. In case of option 2 and 3, the caller decides on whether, the class needs to be loaded dynamically by setting the property `pravega.client.auth.loadDynamic` to true.
 
# REST Client _auth_ Interface
The `REST` client in order to access the Pravega API uses the similar approach as mentioned in the above sections. The custom _auth_ parameters are sent as the part of the `Authorization` HTTP header.

The `REST` server implementation on Pravega **Controller** extracts these headers and passes it to the valid _auth_ plugin implementation. Then it resumes, if the authentication and authorization matches the intended access pattern.
