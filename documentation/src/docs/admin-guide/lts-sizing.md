# Right-Sizing Long-Term Storage

Pravega's design enables users to store stream data virtually without bounds. However, in practical terms, we need
to understand what will be the storage capacity required in Long-Term Storage, either to provision such a system or
to estimate storage costs. Even more, users may have a legacy Long-Term Storage and want to devote part of its
capacity to store Pravega streams. In either case, we need guidelines to estimate the Long-Term Storage space 
requirements for Pravega[[3]](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/issues/4503 ).    

There are two ways to reduce the amount of data stored in a Pravega Stream: _deleting or truncating the Stream_. 
In this guide, we focus on Stream truncation, and more concretely, on how to provision Long-Term Storage capacity
when Stream truncation is performed automatically in Pravega via 
[_Stream auto-retention_](http://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#stream-retention-policies). In this regard,
the main configuration parameters involved are:

- **_`controller.retention.frequency.minutes`_**: The Controller service periodically triggers the enforcement of
Stream auto-retention (i.e., truncation) based on this parameter.
_Type_: `Integer`. _Default_: `30`. _Update-mode_: `per-server`.

- **_`controller.retention.bucket.count`_**: Controllers distribute the Streams that require periodic auto-retention
across the number of (Stream) "buckets" defined in this parameter. Multiple Controller instances will share the load related
to auto-retention by owning a subset of buckets.
_Type_: `Integer`. _Default_: `1`. _Update-mode_: `read-only`.

- **_`controller.retention.thread.count`_**: Number of threads in the Controller devoted to execute Stream auto-retention tasks.
_Type_: `Integer`. _Default_: `1`. _Update-mode_: `per-server`.

- **_`writer.rollover.size.bytes.max`_**: The maximum size of a single Segment Chunk in Storage. While this can 
be configured on a per-segment basis via the Segment Store API, this setting establishes a ceiling to that value. 
No Segment Chunk may exceed this length regardless of how it was configured via the API (if at all). Use this setting 
if you need to meet some hardware limitation with the underlying Storage implementation (i.e., maximum file size).
Valid values: Positive number.
 
We can enforce two types of auto-retention policies on our Streams: _size-based_ and _time-based_. There is also
a new [consumption-based retention model](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/wiki/PDP-47:-Pravega-Consumption-Based-Retention), 
but it can be combined with the previous policies as well. Also, in this section we assume that all the Streams in the 
system are configured with some type of auto-retention.

The Long-Term Storage requirements in a production deployment are dictated by:
- _Rate of data ingestion_: This is the main factor that dictates the Long-Term Storage requirements. Clearly, having
a high data ingestion rate unavoidably leads to higher Long-Term Storage requirements. 
- _Stream retention policy used_: The retention configuration of our Streams is almost as important as the ingestion rate.
That is, we can have a data high ingestion rate on Streams configured with frequent/small retention period/size, 
which would still keep the Long-Term Storage requirements low.
- _Efficiency of serializers_: Pravega only understands bytes, not events. This means that applications writing and
reading events from Pravega are required to provide serializers in order to convert events into bytes and the other way
round. Depending on the type of data being stored and the serializer implementation, the write amplification of user
events into bytes may be significant.
- _System metadata storage of Pravega_: Internally, Pravega stores most of its metadata in Key/Value Tables, which are
backed by regular segments. Thus, the metadata of Pravega is also going to consume some space in Long-Term Storage.
While this storage cost is minor, depending on how metadata-heavy the workload is it may represent 1% to 5% of the 
storage space in most cases (i.e., storing some data in 1 Stream has lower metadata cost than storing the same data in 
1 million Streams).

With the above points in mind, let's go for a practical example. Let's assume that our workload consists on an average
ingestion rate of 1GBps and we have only 1 Stream in the system. Also, the serializers we use in our application have 
a write amplification of 1.3x and we foresee an additional 5% of storage cost related to Pravega's metadata. Given 
that, let's exercise how much Long-Term Storage capacity we would need with the following auto-retention policies:

- _Size-based auto-retention of 1TB_: This policy attempts to keep at least 1TB of data related to our Stream.
Therefore, the Long-Term Storage space needed would be at least: `1TB · 1.3 + 1TB · 0.05 = 1.35TB`. 

- _Time-based retention of 1 day_: With this policy, Pravega will keep data for our Stream for at least 1 day.
This means that our Long-Term Storage may require to store at least: `86400s * 1GBps * 1.3 + 86400s * 1GBps * 0.05 = 116.7TB`.

Note that the above storage estimations are lower bounds. They assume that the Pravega auto-retention service immediately
truncates the Stream once the retention policy has been met. However, the Pravega auto-retention service is implemented
as a background task and should be properly configured under stringent retention requirements. Next, we provide some
guidelines to configure the Pravega auto-retention service:

- _Set a proper retention frequency_: By default, `controller.retention.frequency.minutes=30`. This means that Long-Term
Storage should be provisioned to accommodate at least 30 minutes of data beyond what is configured in the auto-retention
policy, until a Controller instance truncates the Stream. If your cluster should minimize the usage of Long-Term Storage
resources, then you may want to set this parameter to a lower value (e.g., 1-5 minutes).

- _Define the right number of buckets_: Similarly to what happens to Segment Containers, we need to think twice before
setting the number of buckets. That is, if we leave the default value of 1, there would be only one Controller instance 
handling all the work related to auto-retention. For this reason, we recommend to estimate the initial number of Controller 
instances required in your Pravega Cluster: as a rule of thumb, having 1 to 2 Controllers every 3 Segment Stores is enough, 
depending on the metadata load expected (e.g., working with small [Transactions](http://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#transactions) 
or with many Streams induces more metadata workload). Once the number of Controllers for a deployment is estimated,
we can define a number of 4 to 8 times the number of Controllers. That is, if we have 3 Controller instances,
we will configure `controller.retention.bucket.count=24`. With this, we could scale up the number of Controllers and
the new instances will share the load along with with the previous ones.

- _Controller retention thread pool size_: In general, having 1 thread (`controller.retention.thread.count=1`, default)
per Controller devoted to auto-retention should be enough. However, if you expect your workload to be very 
intensive in terms of auto-retention (i.e., thousands of Streams, stringent retention requirements) consider to increase
the thread pool size to 2-4 threads. 

- _Maximum size of single chunk in LTS: In production, it may be required to revisit the value of `writer.rollover.size.bytes.max`.
Limiting the size of chunks in LTS poses a trade-off: if the value is low, the system will achieve fine retention granularity 
(good) but extra metadata overhead (not so good). On the contrary, a high value in this parameter induces coarse retention 
granularity with less metadata overhead. Limiting chunk sizes between 1GB-16GB seems reasonable in many scenarios.
