# Pravega Connectors

Connectors allow integrating Pravega with different data sources and sinks.  

- [Flink Connector](https://github.com/pravega/flink-connectors)

The initial connector supported is Flink which enables building end-to-end stream processing pipelines with Pravega.  This also allows reading and writing data to external data sources and sinks via Flink Streaming Connectors.

#### In Experimental Stage

- [Logstash](https://github.com/pravega/logstash-output-pravega) 
- [Hadoop Connector](https://github.com/pravega/hadoop-connectors)
