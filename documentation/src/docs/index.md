# Pravega Overview

Pravega is a storage system that exposes **Stream** as the main primitive for continuous and unbounded data. A Pravega stream is a durable, elastic, append-only, unbounded sequence of bytes having good performance and strong consistency.  

Read [Pravega Concepts](pravega-concepts.md) for more details.

## Key Features 

-   **Exactly-Once Semantics:** Pravega ensures that each event is delivered and processed exactly once, with exact ordering guarantees, despite failures in clients, servers or the network.

-   **Auto Scaling:** Pravega automatically changes the parallelism of the individual data streams to accommodate fluctuations in data ingestion rate.

-   **Distributed Computing Primitive:** Pravega is not only a great storage service for data streams, it can also be used as a durable and consistent messaging service across processes. Pravega provides unique abstractions, which aids the users to build advanced services, like distributed consensus and leader election.

-   **Write Performance:** Pravega shrinks write latency to milliseconds, and seamlessly scales to handle high throughput reads and writes from thousands of concurrent clients, making it ideal for IoT and other time sensitive applications.

-   **Unlimited Retention:** Pravega decouples brokering of events from the actual data storage. This allows Pravega to transparently move data events from low-latency, durable storage tier to a cloud storage service (e.g., HDFS, Amazon S3, or DellEMC Isilon/ECS), while clients are agnostic to the actual location of data.

-   **Storage Efficiency:** Pravega is used to build data processing pipelines that may combine batch and real-time applications without duplicating data for every step of the pipeline. This is possible because Pravega unifies stream (ordered) and batch (parallel) access to data events for data processing engines.

-   **Durability:** Pravega persists and protects data events once the write operation is acknowledged to the client.

-   **Transaction Support:** A Pravega Transaction ensures that a set of events are written to a stream atomically. This is a key feature for distributed streaming applications requiring exactly-once guarantees on their output.

-   **Security and pluggable role-based access control:** Pravega can be deployed by the administrators securely by enabling TLS for communications and can deploy their own implementation of role-based access control plugin.
