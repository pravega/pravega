# Deploying on DC/OS

DC/OS is one of the target runtime environments for Pravega. There is a DC/OS framework available for running pravega. This is a work in progress and will be submitted to the DC/OS universe when it is complete.

Pravega can also be run on DC/OS by running each docker container in marathon.

Note: Pravega is not compatible with the HDFS package that ships with DC/OS 1.9. That HDFS does not meet the required version 2.7.

TODO

- Link to DC/OS framework project
