# Pravega Connectors

Connectors allow integrating Pravega with different data sources and sinks.  

The initial connector supported is Flink which enables building end-to-end stream processing pipelines with Pravega.  This also allows reading and writing data to external data sources and sinks via Flink Streaming Connectors.
