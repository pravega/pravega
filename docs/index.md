# Pravega Overview

Pravega is an open source storage primitive implementing **Streams** for continuous and unbounded data. A Pravega stream is a durable, elastic, append-only, unbounded sequence of bytes that has good performance and strong consistency.  

Read [Pravega Concepts](pravega-concepts.md) for more details.

## Key Features 

-   Exactly-Once Semantics - Ensure that each event is delivered and processed exactly once, with exact ordering guarantees, despite failures in clients, servers or the network.

-   Auto Scaling - Unlike systems with static partitioning, Pravega can automatically scale individual data streams to accommodate changes in data ingestion rate.

-   Distributed Computing Primitive - Pravega is great for distributed computing; it can be used as a data storage mechanism, for messaging between processes and for other distributed computing services such as leader election.

-   Write Efficiency - Pravega shrinks write latency to milliseconds, and seamlessly scales to handle high throughput reads and writes from thousands of concurrent clients, making it ideal for IoT and other time sensitive applications.

-   Unlimited Retention - Ingest, process and retain data in streams forever. Use same paradigm to access both real-time and historical events stored in Pravega.

-   Storage Efficiency - Use Pravega to build pipelines of data processing, combining batch, real-time and other applications without duplicating data for every step of the pipeline.

-   Durability - Don't compromise between performance, durability and consistency.
    Pravega persists and protects data before the write operation is acknowledged to the client.
    
-   Transaction Support - A developer uses a Pravega Transaction to ensure that a set of events are written to a stream atomically.
