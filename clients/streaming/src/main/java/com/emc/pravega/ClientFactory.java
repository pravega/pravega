/**
 * Used to create Producers, Consumers, and Synchronizers operating on a stream.
 * 
 * Events that a published to a stream can be consumed by a consumer. All events can be consumed
 * with exactly once semantics provided the consumer has the ability to restore to the correct
 * position upon failure. See {@link Consumer#getPosition}
 * <p>
 * A note on ordering: Events inside of a stream have a strict order, but may need to be divided
 * between multiple consumers for scaling. In order to process events in parallel on different
 * hosts and still have some ordering guarentees; events published to a stream have a
 * routingKey see {@link Producer#publish}. Events within a routing key are strictly ordered (IE:
 * They must go the the same consumer or its replacement). For other events, within a single
 * consumer, the ordering is dictated by {@link EventRead#getWriteTimeCounter()} However as
 * {@link ConsumerGroup}s process events in parallel there is no ordering between different
 * consumers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A note on scaling: Because a stream can grow in its event rate, streams are divided into
 * Segments. For the most part this is an implementation detail. However its worth understanding
 * that the way a stream is divided between multiple consumers in a group that wish to split the
 * messages between them is by giving different segments to different consumers. For this reason
 * when creating a consumer a notification is provided. {@link EventRead#isRoutingRebalance()} In
 * the case of a consumer group, this is automated.
 * 
 * Otherwise this can be done by creating new consumer by calling: {@link RebalancerUtils#rebalance}
 * .
