/**
 * Provides a means to have state that is synchronized between many processes.
 * 
 * The pattern is to have an object of type StateT that can be updated by processing objects of
 * type UpdateT. Each host can perform logic based on its current StateT object and
 * apply updates by constructing an UpdateT to represent the update and passing it to
 * {@link #attemptUpdate()}. Updates from other hosts can be obtained by calling
 * {@link #getLatestState()}
 * 
 * Updates can be conditional on the state provided being the most recent revision.
 * This provides a strong consistency with optimistic concurrency.
 * 
 * As with any optimistic concurrency system, this works best when optimism is justified:
 * IE: Odds are another host is not updating the state at the exact same time.
 * 
 * All methods on this interface are blocking.
 * 
 * Because they are held in memory and transmitted over the network, state objects are updates
 * should be relatively compact. Implementations might explicitly enforce size limits.
 * 
 * @param <StateT> The type of the object whose updates are being synchronized.
 * @param <UpdateT> The type of updates applied to the state object.
