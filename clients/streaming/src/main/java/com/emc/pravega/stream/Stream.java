/**
 * A stream can be thought of as an infinite sequence of events.
 * A stream can be published to or consumed from.
 * A stream is:
 * Append only (Events in it are immutable once published)
 * Infinite (There are no limitations in size or time to how many events can go into a stream)
 * Strongly Consistent (Events are either in the stream or they are not, and not subject to reordering once written)
 * Scalable (The rate of events in a stream can greatly exceed the capacity of any single host)
 * <p>
 * Events that a published to a stream can be consumed by a consumer. All events can be consumed with exactly once
 * semantics provided the consumer has the ability to restore to the correct position upon failure. See
 * {@link Consumer#getPosition}
 * <p>
 * A note on ordering:
 * Events inside of a stream have a strict order, but may need to be devised between multiple consumers for scaling.
 * Because events being processed in parallel on different hosts cannot have ordering semantics a few things are done.
 * Events published to a stream have a routingKey see {@link Producer#publish}.
 * Events within a routing key are strictly ordered (IE: They must go the the same consumer or its replacement).
 * For other events, within a single consumer, the ordering is dictated by the {@link Orderer}
 * If the Orderer used by the consumer is consistent, order of all events seen by that consumer is strict.
 * IE: the stream can be multiple times from the same position and the events will always be in the same order.
 * Other implementations of Orderer are used to try to lower latency etc. But none of them will change the semantic that
 * within a routingKey ordering is strict.
 * <p>
 * A note on scaling:
 * Because a stream can grow in its event rate, streams are divided into Segments. For the most part this is an
 * implementation detail. However its worth understanding that the way a stream is divided between multiple consumers in
 * a group that wish to split the messages between them is by giving different segments to different consumers. For this
 * reason when creating a consumer a {@link RateChangeListener} is provided, that can help scale up or down the number
 * of consumers if the number of segments has changed in response to a change in the rate of events in the stream. For
 * the most part this is done by calling {@link RebalancerUtils#rebalance}.
