## Instructions for using this file:
# 1. Settings are namespaced. The prefix indicates the component for which the configuration applies.
# 2. Most settings have default values hardcoded inside the code. Those are commented out (with the default value set)
#    in this file.
# 3. Some settings do not have overrides and require a value be set in this file (or via command-line). Those settings
#    are labeled with the label 'Required.' in this file.
# 4. Each setting (especially non-string ones) have a label named 'Valid values' which describes how a valid value should
#    look like.
# 5. Most settings have 'Recommended values'. These are guidelines (but not requirements) as to how to properly set the
#    values for those settings based on desired use cases.
#
# Each of these settings can be overridden from the command like by specifying a Java System Property.
# Example: setting 'pravegaservice.service.listener.port' has a default value of 12345, but it can be overridden to a different
#          value via the command-line:
#                java -Dpravegaservice.service.listener.port=5689 ...
#          which will set the value for that setting to 5689, regardless of what this file contains.

# Maximum size (in bytes) for the Local Shared Cache (shared by all Segment Containers on this Segment Store instance).

# Recommended values: Multiples of 1GB, but less than XX:MaxDirectMemorySize. Choosing a lower size will conserve memory

# Valid values: 1 to 100 (inclusive).
# Recommended values: Between 75 and 85. It is not recommended to choose a very high value as that may leave very little

# Recommended values: Between {pravegaservice.cache.utilization.percent.target + 10} and 95. Setting a value too close to
# pravegaservice.cache.utilization.percent.target will cause the Segment Store to apply maximum throttling as soon as that
# limit is reached, which may cause it to have sudden, multi-second stalls in the ingestion pipeline. It is not recommended

# Maximum amount of time (in seconds) to keep a block of data in the Cache.

# write operations to wait on it, so when it does happen, it adds a bit of latency. They also have a direct effect on the
# recovery time (upon recovery, the entire DurableDataLog needs to be processed, so the further apart such Checkpoints
# are, the more time it will take). Based on the application requirements, it may be desirable to choose more frequent
# Checkpoints (if a speedy recovery is desired and no discernible impact on online performance is noted), or less frequent

# A note on Cache Management. Each append to a Stream Segment and each cache miss will cause an entry to be written to
# the Cache (as such, entries have a variable length). The Cache is shared across all Segment Containers in a Pravega
# SegmentStore instance and its entry lifecycle is determined by three major variables: cacheMaxSize, cacheMaxTimeMillis
# and cacheGenerationTimeMillis. A Cache Generation is a proxy for time passage (instead of using a single time-based stamp,
# each cache entry has a generation id. All hits (or additions) during a generation will get that generation id. The Cache
# Manager adjusts the current generation and oldest permissible generation to manage the cache (entries with a generation
# older than the oldest ones are candidates for eviction). The oldest generation is increased either when the physical
# amount of time between now and the oldest generation exceeds cacheMaxTimeMillis or when there is cache pressure and
# the maximum amount of data in the cache exceeds cacheMaxSize.
