 The current version of mkdocs plugin depends on 'use-python' plugin of version 1.2 which has a known issue
 when using the virtualenv. To overcome this issue the usage of virtualenv must be disabled.

 Don't forget to enable it once 'mkdocs' plugin is upgraded to the latest version (depends on gradle upgrade as well)
