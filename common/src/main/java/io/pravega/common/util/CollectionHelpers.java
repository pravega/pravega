     * Performs a binary search on the given sorted list using the given comparator.

     * This method is different than that in java.util.Collections in the following ways:
     * 1. This one searches by a simple comparator, vs the ones in the Collections class which search for a specific element.
     * This one is useful if we don't have an instance of a search object or we want to implement a fuzzy comparison.
     * 2. This one returns -1 if the element is not found. The ones in the Collections class return (-(start+1)), which is
     * the index where the item should be inserted if it were to go in the list.
     *
     * @param list       The list to search on.
     * @param comparator The comparator to use for comparison. Returns -1 if sought item is before the current item,
     *                   +1 if it is after or 0 if an exact match.
     * @param <T>        Type of the elements in the list.
     * @return The index of the sought item, or -1 if not found.
