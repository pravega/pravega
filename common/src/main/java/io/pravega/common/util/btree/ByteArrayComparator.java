/**
 * Performs a lexicographic bitwise comparison of two byte arrays of the same length.
 *
 * Lexicographic bitwise comparison:
 * - Consider two arrays A and B, with each having L bits (L is a multiple of 8).
 * - Define A{n} and B{n} as the bit at position n in A and B, respectively. This can be either 0 or 1.
 * - A precedes B if there exists bit position i such that for all bit positions j smaller than i,
 * then A{j} is equal to B{j}, A{i} is 0 and B{i} is 1.
 * - A is equal to B if the values of all bit positions in both arrays match.
 *
 * Lexicographic bitwise comparison matches the natural order of numbers when serialized as unsigned (i.e., using the
 * specialized methods in {@link BitConverter}) since they avoid the complications involved with interpreting individual
 * bytes with the first bit set to 1 using 2's complement (128 is before 127 if we used signed bytes).
 *
 * For example:
 * - Consider any two Longs L1 and L2.
 * - Let S1 be the result of {@link BitConverter#writeUnsignedLong) when applied to L1, and S2 the result when applied to L2.
 * - Then {@link Long#compare} applied to (L1, L2) is equal to {@link ByteArrayComparator#compare} applied to (S1, S2).
 * - This equality would not hold should L1 and L2 be serialized using {@link BitConverter#writeLong} or if we used plain
 * (signed) byte comparison internall.
