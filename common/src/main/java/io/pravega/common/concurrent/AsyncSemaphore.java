/**
 * A synchronization primitive that allows executing arbitrary (concurrent) tasks, where each task requires a well-known
 * number of credits, subject to a total number of credits being available. Each task's successful execution will "borrow"
 * its share of credits, and a task cannot execute if the number of credits available is insufficient. Credits may be
 * restored externally using the {@link #release} method.
 *
 * This is similar to {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore}, except that this class allows for asynchronous processing
 * and each task can request an arbitrary number of credits. It can be useful in solving problems making use of the
 * Leaky Bucket Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket).
