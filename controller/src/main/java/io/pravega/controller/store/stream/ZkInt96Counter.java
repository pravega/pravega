/**
 * A zookeeper based int 96 counter. At bootstrap, and upon each refresh, it retrieves a unique starting counter from the 
 * Int96 space. It does this by getting and updating an Int96 value stored in zookeeper. It updates zookeeper node with the 
 * next highest value that others could access. 
 * So upon each retrieval from zookeeper, it has a starting counter value and a ceiling on counters it can assign until a refresh
 * is triggered. Any caller requesting for nextCounter will get a unique value from the range owned by this counter. 
 * Once it exhausts the range, it refreshes the range by contacting zookeeper and repeating the steps described above.
